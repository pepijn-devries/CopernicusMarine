> `{CopernicusMarine}` Easily access information from <https://data.marine.copernicus.eu>

## Overview

<a href="https://github.com/pepijn-devries/CopernicusMarine/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" alt="CopernicusMarine logo" align="right" /></a>

[Copernicus Marine Service Information](https://marine.copernicus.eu/about) is a programme subsidised by the
European Commission. Its mission is to provide free authoritative information on the oceans physical and
biogeochemical state. The `{CopernicusMarine}` R package is developed apart from this programme and facilitates
retrieval of information from <https://data.marine.copernicus.eu>. With the package you can:

 * List available marine data for Copernicus and provide meta-information.
 * Download and use the data directly in R.

## Why use `{CopernicusMarine}`

Previously, there was only a MOTU client available for Python. Therefore, automating Copernicus downloads in R
used to require installation of python and its [motuclient](https://pypi.org/project/motuclient/) package. The
`{CopernicusMarine}` R package has a much simpler installation procedure (see below) and does not depend on
third party software.

## Installation

> Get CRAN version
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("CopernicusMarine")
```
> Get development version on github
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('pepijn-devries/CopernicusMarine')
```

## Usage

The package provides an interface between R and the Copernicus Marine services. Note that for some of these
services you need an account and have to comply with
[specific terms](https://marine.copernicus.eu/user-corner/service-commitments-and-licence). The usage section
briefly shows three different ways of obtaining data from Copernicus:

 * [Using the MOTU server](#sec-motu)
 * [Using the FTP server](#sec-ftp)
 * [Using the WMS server](#sec-wms)

Please check the manual for complete documentation of the package.

<h3 id="sec-motu">Subsetting data using MOTU server</h3>

The code below assumes that you have registered your account details using `option(CopernicusMarine_uid = "my_user_name")` and
`option(CopernicusMarine_pwd = "my_password")`. If you are comfortable that it is secure enough, you can also store these
options in your `.Rprofile` such that they will be loaded each session. Otherwise, you can also provide your account details
as arguments to the functions.

The example below demonstrates how to subset a specific layer for a specific product. The subset is constrained by
the `region`, `timerange`, `verticalrange` and `sub_variables` arguments. The subset is downloaded to the temporary
file specified with `destination` and can be read using the [`{stars}`](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) package.

```{r motu-subset, eval=TRUE}
destination <- tempfile("copernicus", fileext = ".nc")

copernicus_download_motu(
  destination   = destination,
  product       = "GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024",
  layer         = "cmems_mod_glo_phy-cur_anfc_0.083deg_P1D-m",
  variable      = "sea_water_velocity",
  output        = "netcdf",
  region        = c(-1, 50, 10, 55),
  timerange     = c("2021-01-01", "2021-01-02"),
  verticalrange = c(0, 2),
  sub_variables = c("uo", "vo")
)

mydata <- stars::read_stars(destination)

plot(mydata["vo"], col = hcl.colors(100), axes = TRUE)
```

<h3 id="sec-ftp">Downloading a complete Copernicus marine product</h3>

If you don't want to subset the data and want the complete set, you can use the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) if
that service is available for your product. First you can list files available for a specific product:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
cop_ftp_files <- copernicus_ftp_list("GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024", "cmems_mod_glo_phy-cur_anfc_0.083deg_P1D-m")
cop_ftp_files
```

Downloading the first file can be done with `copernicus_ftp_get(cop_ftp_files$url[[1]], tempdir())`, where the
file would be stored in a temporary directory. By default the progress is printed as files can be very large and
may take some time to download.

<h3 id="sec-wms">Copernicus Web Map Services (WMS)</h3>

Web Map Services (WMS) allow to quickly plot pre-rendered images onto a map. This may not be useful when
you need the data for analyses but is handy for quick visualisations, inspection or presentation of data.
In R it is very easy to add WMS layers to an interactive map using [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
widgets. This is demonstrated with the example below (note that in the documentation the map is only shown
statically and is not interactive).

```{r leaflet, eval=TRUE}
leaflet::leaflet() %>%
  leaflet::setView(lng = 3, lat = 54, zoom = 4) %>%
  leaflet::addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery") %>%
  addCopernicusWMSTiles(
    product     = "GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024",
    layer       = "cmems_mod_glo_phy-thetao_anfc_0.083deg_P1D-m",
    variable    = "thetao"
  )
```

When you want to use WMS tiles in static plots, you could download and store specific regions of the tiles
as a [geo-referenced tiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) file for future use. Use `copernicus_wms2geotiff`
for that purpose.

Note that the WMS functions may not work on systems that don't support GDAL utils.

### Citing the data you use

A Copernicus account comes with several terms of use. One of these is that you
[properly cite](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/articles/4444611-how-to-cite-or-reference-copernicus-marine-products-and-services)
the data you use in publications. In fact, we also have credit the data used in this documentation, which can be easily
done with the following code:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
copernicus_cite_product("GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024")
```

## Resources

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cop_det <- copernicus_product_details("GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024")
```

 * [E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu)
 * `r sprintf("[%s - %s (%s); DOI:%s](https://doi.org/%s)", cop_det$title, cop_det$id, cop_det$creationDate, cop_det$doi, cop_det$doi)`
