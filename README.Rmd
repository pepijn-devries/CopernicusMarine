## Overview

[Copernicus Marine Service Information](https://marine.copernicus.eu/about) is a programme subsidised by the
European Commission. Its mission is to provide free authoritative information on the oceans physical and
biogeochemical state. The `CopernicusMarine` R package is developed apart from this programme and facilitates
retrieval of information from <https://data.marine.copernicus.eu>. With the package you can:

 * List available marine data for Copernicus and provide meta-information.
 * Download and use the data directly in R.

## Why use `CopernicusMarine`

Copernicus Marine offers access to their data services through a
[Python application interface](https://pypi.org/project/copernicusmarine/).
For R users this requires complex installation procedures and is difficult to maintain in
a stable R package. The `CopernicusMarine` R package has
a much simpler installation procedure (see below) and does not depend on
third party software, other than packages available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Installation

Install CRAN release:

```{r install1, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("CopernicusMarine")
```

Install latest developmental version from R-Universe:

```{r install2, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("CopernicusMarine", repos = c('https://pepijn-devries.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

## Usage

The package provides an interface between R and the Copernicus Marine services. Note that for some of these
services you need an account and have to comply with
[specific terms](https://marine.copernicus.eu/user-corner/service-commitments-and-licence). The usage section
briefly shows three different ways of obtaining data from Copernicus:

 * [Downloading a subset](#sec-subset)
 * [Downloading a full dataset](#sec-full)
 * [Using the WMTS server](#sec-wtms)

Please check the manual for complete documentation of the package.

<h3 id="sec-subset">Downloading a subset</h3>

The example below demonstrates how to subset a specific layer for a specific product. The subset is constrained by
the `region`, `timerange` and `verticalrange` arguments. The subset is downloaded to memory
represented as a [`stars`](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) object.

```{r download-subset, eval=TRUE, fig.alt="Example plots of downloaded subsets"}
my_data <-
  cms_download_subset(
    product       = "GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024",
    layer         = "cmems_mod_glo_phy-cur_anfc_0.083deg_P1D-m",
    variable      = c("uo", "vo"),
    region        = c(-1, 50, 10, 55),
    timerange     = c("2025-01-01", "2025-01-02"),
    verticalrange = c(0, -2),
    progress      = FALSE
)

plot(my_data["vo"], col = hcl.colors(100), axes = TRUE)
```

<h3 id="sec-full">Downloading a complete Copernicus marine product</h3>

If you don't want to subset the data and want the complete set, you can download
complete native files, if these are available for your product.
You can list available files with (restricted to first 10 results with `max=10`):

```{r native1}
native_files <-
  cms_list_native_files(
    "GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024",
    "cmems_mod_glo_phy-cur_anfc_0.083deg_P1D-m",
    max = 10)
native_files
```

Downloading a specific (or multiple file) can be done with:

```{r native2, eval=FALSE}
cms_download_native(
  destination   = tempdir(),
  product       = "GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024",
  layer         = "cmems_mod_glo_phy_anfc_0.083deg_PT1H-m",
  pattern       = "m_20220630"
)
```
The file, whose file name matches the pattern, will be stored in the specified destination folder.
By default the progress is printed as files can be very large and may take some time to download.

<h3 id="sec-wmts">Copernicus Web Map Tile Services (WMTS)</h3>

Web Map Tile Services (WMTS) allow to quickly plot pre-rendered images onto a map. This may not be useful when
you need the data for analyses but is handy for quick visualisations, inspection or presentation of data.
In R it is very easy to add WMTS layers to an interactive map using [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).
This page is rendered statically and resulting in a non-interactive map.

```{r leaflet, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.alt="Static example image of a leaflet map"}
leaflet::leaflet() |>
  leaflet::setView(lng = 3, lat = 54, zoom = 4) |>
  leaflet::addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery") |>
  addCmsWMTSTiles(
    product     = "GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024",
    layer       = "cmems_mod_glo_phy-thetao_anfc_0.083deg_P1D-m",
    variable    = "thetao"
  )
```

### Citing the data you use

A Copernicus account comes with several terms of use. One of these is that you
[properly cite](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/articles/4444611-how-to-cite-copernicus-marine-products-and-services)
the data you use in publications. In fact, we also have credit the data used in this documentation, which can be easily
done with the following code:

```{r cite, eval=TRUE}
cms_cite_product("GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024")$doi
```

## Resources

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cop_det <- cms_product_details("GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024")
```

 * [E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu)
 * `r sprintf("[%s - %s (%s); DOI:%s](https://doi.org/%s)", cop_det$title, cop_det$id, cop_det$properties$creationDate, cop_det[["sci:doi"]], cop_det[["sci:doi"]])`
